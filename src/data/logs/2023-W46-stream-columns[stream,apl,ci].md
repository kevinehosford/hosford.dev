### Overview
Hammered on the logs stream UX: column settings finally stick, raw dumps behave, and the editor caught up with the typography it depends on. Also kept CI noise low by freezing the staging release workflow and refreshing the visual baselines.

### Highlights
- [#1168](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1168), [#1142](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1142) — Synced `AplFormRenderer` with `streamSettingsStore` so user-selected columns persist, and taught `LogStreamStore` to carry `queryMetaFields` separately from `project`. The matches table now surfaces an alert when every column goes missing (AXM-2032) and hides the raw column whenever the query controls projections, which keeps feature-flagged layouts from reintroducing clutter.
- [#1164](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1164), [#1154](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1154) — Hardened `formatAnyValue` for arrays, numbers, and nested objects, adding vitest coverage so formatter regressions surface early. Raw data cells pass `{ space: 0 }` when stringifying, keeping wide JSON blobs on a single line, and the e2e screenshots confirm the cleaned-up layout.
- [#1153](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1153), [#1138](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1138) — The APL editor now waits for `document.fonts.ready` before measuring so cursors stop drifting while fonts load, closing AXM-672. Query refreshes also default back to quick-range view if the saved query used one, preventing unexpected jumps to absolute timestamps.
- [#1159](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1159), [#1144](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1144) — Mended dashboard Playwright selectors after Monaco’s markup changed and captured fresh Backstop references to settle the axis dashboards. These updates keep our visual diff workflow green while the field list work churns.
- [#1147](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1147) — Hard-disabled the staging release GitHub Action while we triage downstream failures, short-circuiting the job with a literal `false` guard so no one accidentally publishes. That pause reduces noise in the release channel while we audit the pipeline.
