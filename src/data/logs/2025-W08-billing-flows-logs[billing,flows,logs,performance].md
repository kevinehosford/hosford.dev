### Overview
Delivered the new billing usage surface, shipped Chronicle as a flow destination, and put serious polish on log context and tabular rendering performance.

### Highlights
- [#3890](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3890), [#3906](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3906) — Split the billing navigation into Plan vs Usage, added the `UsagePage` with `UsageBar` bars and `getLineItemsUsageQuery`, and refreshed the license slide-out to show retention windows and allowance bars. Wired the new product IDs from the API and tightened loading indicators around the plan header. Lesson: separating plan configuration from usage stats let us reuse the same license limits in both contexts.
- [#3810](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3810), [#3896](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3896) — Introduced the Chronicle destination option by extending the flow schema, Summary component, and `EditDestinationForm` validation, including endpoint preview support in the destinations list. Followed up by fixing state resets in the destination form so validation errors clear correctly. Lesson: keeping destination props typed in the shared codegen meant the UI surfaced new back-end fields with minimal glue.
- [#3850](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3850), [#3904](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3904) — Rewrote `padRowsForField` to precompute group examples and only backfill missing time buckets once per group/value, added vitest coverage, and recorded a new Playwright scenario to confirm tabular charts render without holes. Also updated the feature-flag mock plumbing so tests can coerce camelCase flags. Lesson: a tighter pad algorithm dramatically dropped CPU when displaying wide tables.
- [#3905](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3905) — Gave “View in context” a proper workspace: the targeted event row now uses the blue highlight palette, the panel supports selecting multiple fields for scoped context queries, and we build a deep-link via `stringifyWithQM`. Added guardrails so log streaming only shows the “loading past” banner while polling and ignored unusable cursors. Lesson: treating context selection as a first-class interaction makes tracing spikes far less frustrating.
