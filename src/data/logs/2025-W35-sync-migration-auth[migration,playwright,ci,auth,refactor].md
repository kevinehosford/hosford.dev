### Overview
Shipping Nexus felt like juggling this week: we stood up dedicated deploy workflows, chased down a memory leak that only reproed in long-lived Node processes, and kept the dashboard/query experience aligned with the new feature-flag rules. Flows got lighter-weight progress polling, streams kept their filters straight, and we put more end-to-end guardrails in place around the console shell.

### Highlights
- [#5388](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5388), [#5430](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5430), [#5487](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5487), [#5486](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5486) — Split Nexus deploys into preview/staging/production workflows with the updated Vercel action so we can ship `--archive=tgz` bundles without hitting upload limits. The staging job now targets the proper Vercel environment, and CI-frontend hands off to the new workflow set instead of trying to deploy inline.
- [#5425](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5425) — Investigated and patched the memory leak that showed up whenever the Node server stuck around for Playwright runs: we now tear down the router listeners correctly, cache the Nitro app between requests, and captured the debugging notes in `docs/temp/memory-leak-investigation.md` alongside a (skipped-for-now) regression test.
- [#5373](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5373), [#5387](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5387), [#5403](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5403) — Flow progress once again derives from replay events instead of hammering the `axiom-flow-history` dataset, and Log Stream filtering is typed end-to-end so view-in-context links don’t lose their parameters. The datasets route now respects feature flags by routing legacy users through the `_legacy` page while the new experience lights up only when the flag says it should.
- [#5359](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5359), [#5360](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5360) — Extended the query builder to support `has`/`not-has`, wiring the new operators through the APL serializer and unit tests. Retired the `billingAddOns` feature flag in favor of `isEnvEuProd`, which simplifies the permit logic across settings pages and updates the Playwright screenshots accordingly.
- [#5357](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5357), [#5358](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5358), [#5415](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5415) — Centralized Playwright auth setup behind the session fixture, introduced page objects for the settings console, and added full query-page seeds/tests so we can regression-test the new builder behavior. The additional seeds wire in console QA scenarios and reduce the duplicated locator logic across suites.
- [#5416](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5416) — Re-enabled Vite source maps now that the build no longer runs inside Vercel, giving us stack traces in Sentry again without tripping the old memory ceilings.
