### Overview
Flows took center stage: I moved the experience onto the new tiled layout, adopted the shared page nav, and lined up the pieces for continuous runs. Rounded things out with destination form polish, chart option fixes, and fresh e2e coverage.

### Highlights
- [#2680](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2680), [#2738](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2738), [#2750](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2750) — Ported flows to the new `PageLayout`/`PageSidebar` primitives, reorganized the details view into tiled sections, and wired the page nav so the shell matches design. Continuous runs hide behind a new `release-canary` flag, so only experimental orgs see the toggle while we iterate on the UI.
- [#2757](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2757), [#2709](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2709), [#2708](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2708) — Enhanced destinations: the Axiom endpoint became a dropdown (with “custom” for self-hosted URLs), HTTP auth now renders as a password field, and we only flip the prerelease banner once the signup form is submitted so folks can back out safely.
- [#2756](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2756), [#2752](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2752), [#2742](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2742), [#2726](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2726), [#2724](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2724) — Squashed a handful of UI papercuts: restored the active styling on `axi-toggle`, ensured chart option submenus render in the right portal, moved event-timeline color hacks into the store so replays keep their palette, and taught the log stream “scroll to bottom” to target the last row so virtualization doesn’t lose sync.
- [#2702](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2702), [#2731](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2731) — Added happy-path Playwright flows tests (with mock HARs for both flag states) and fixed the `ci-e2e-approve` workflow to install its dependencies, keeping approvals automated.
