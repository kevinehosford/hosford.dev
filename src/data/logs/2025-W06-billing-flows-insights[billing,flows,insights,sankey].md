### Overview
Ran a full pass on billing and flows: the billing screens now have the new plan and usage treatments, and flows gained an Insights sandbox backed by a Sankey chart. Wrapped up with resilience fixes for our flow progress queries so they keep working even when history datasets are missing fields.

### Highlights
- [#3799](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3799), [#3783](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3783) — Rebuilt `BillingPage` around locally scoped `BillingStore`/`StripeStore` instances, recalculated reset dates from `planCreated`, and routed plan selection through the existing modal. Added the downgrade menu and an “Upgrade” hero for non-personal plans, plus helpers like `fmtLeadingDateYear` and `QueryKeys.subscriptionState` to hydrate the page with the new subscription endpoints. Lesson: isolating the store per page keeps modal state and React Query caches from bleeding across settings routes.
- [#3808](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3808), [#3816](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3816) — Extended `UsageBillingPage` with a current breakdown section that pulls `getSubscriptionStateQuery`, renders plan usage in the new table components, and introduces a `SettingsSlideOut`-based billing history drawer that streams invoices via `getInvoicesQuery`. Lesson: centralising billing breakdowns with reusable slideouts simplifies the upcoming quota visualisations.
- [#3788](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3788), [#3795](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3795), [#3779](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3779) — Split the flows pages into `FlowsHome`, `Flow`, and `Destinations`, created a shared `FlowsSidebar`, and wired an `/flows/insights` route (dev-only) that queries flow stats and feeds them into the new `SankeyChart` component. Lesson: breaking flows into smaller routes made it trivial to add the Insights experiment without tangling the existing replay UI.
- [#3803](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3803) — Updated the flow progress query to wrap the `error` field in `ensure_field(...)` so we don’t explode when the history dataset lacks that column, and refreshed the Playwright HAR/snapshot to capture the expected render. Lesson: defensive APL keeps the Insights chart stable even while ingest pipelines evolve.
- [#3796](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3796) — Dropped a `Panel` example into the design doc so the team can reference current panel patterns while we keep iterating on settings surfaces.
