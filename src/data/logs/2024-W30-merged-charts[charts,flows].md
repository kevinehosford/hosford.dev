### Overview
Big week for charting and flows: I delivered merged percentile charts with better theming, expanded the destination catalogue, and layered in the new field details popover while tightening a few workflow quirks.

### Highlights
- [#2523](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2523), [#2544](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2544), [#2545](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2545), [#2548](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2548), [#2555](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2555) — Completed merged charts: `ElementsDatasetStore` now builds combined percentile series, `LineChart`/`HistogramChart` handle shaded ranges and `displayNull` in-theme, and the status bar collapses options when panels share axes. Highlighting works across dark/light tokens and the merged tooltips stay legible.
- [#2516](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2516), [#2522](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2522), [#2538](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2538), [#2507](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2507) — Added Elasticsearch, Azure, and OTEL traces destinations with the refreshed FormCombobox, wired in data-format selectors, and enforced min/max dates on the replay time picker. The combined swagger/codegen update keeps backend types in sync while the form UIs render the right hints.
- [#2429](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2429), [#2525](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2525), [#2518](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2518) — Shipped the Query Fields “field details” popover (with filter buttons and value histograms), then backfilled APL helpers so `project-away` and numeric search operands highlight correctly in the editor and tests.
- [#2535](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2535), [#2528](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2528), [#2529](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2529), [#2531](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2531) — Let developers toggle feature flags via `frontend/.env`, relaxed the focus trap around dropdown menus, removed the upgrade-insecure-requests header for Safari local dev, and tweaked the Playwright pass/fail threshold so slow CI environments stop flaking.
