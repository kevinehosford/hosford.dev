### Overview
Stabilized the authentication stack in advance of release: IDP callbacks now loop through the `axiom` provider, errors land on a branded screen, and sessions respect the refreshed cookie lifetime. Backfilled dashboards and log navigation polish, rethemed the org onboarding flow, and kept the EU release machinery humming while quarantining the noisiest tests.

### Highlights
- [#5822](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5822), [#5813](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5813), [#5751](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5751), [#5754](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5754), [#5757](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5757), [#5778](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5778), [#5764](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5764) — Reworked the BetterAuth stack so IDP-initiated sign-ins hit a branded `frapi/auth/error` page instead of the vendor default, with Playwright coverage to prove the redirect path. The OAuth callback now hijacks the `axiom` provider end-to-end, verifies emails coming back from the IDP, stretches session lifetimes to match our cookie cache, and deletes the unused secondary storage adapter to keep Redis out of the loop.
- [#5776](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5776), [#5772](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5772), [#5781](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5781), [#5747](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5747) — Rethemed the org chooser and new-org form onto the Panel layout, ditched the bespoke SCSS module, and disabled SSR on the `/profile` route so queries hydrate cleanly. Getting started no longer marks steps complete before the data loads, billing queries coerce empty responses to `null` for React Query, and endpoint edits look at `dirtyFields` so we only patch when the operator actually changed settings.
- [#5763](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5763), [#5773](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5773), [#5771](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5771), [#5774](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5774), [#5779](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5779), [#5746](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5746) — Swapped in `query-string` with custom `stringifySearch`/`parseSearch` hooks and regenerated the v2 Atlas client so dashboard filters stop double-quoting values. `queryResponseSideEffects` now strips the lingering `relative` param (with new tests), logs view-in-context clears its `context` slug before opening the sidebar, and saved queries construct real TanStack link options so navigation works again. We also moved the Logs stream filter onto React Query for dataset metadata and ensured StreamSettingsStore initializes column settings, while the note editor navigates back to the dashboard on save.
- [#5804](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5804), [#5785](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5785), [#5789](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5789) — Purged the legacy Elements context that Safari choked on, imported Kusto utilities statically, and threaded explicit `timeZone` props through every chart so dashboards render without the “uninitialized variable” errors. Trace routes now coerce params like `spanId` and `traceStart` to strings before validation, and we bundled the integration icon SVGs into `public/static/media` so the new cards ship the right logos in both light and dark themes.
- [#5765](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5765), [#5769](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5769), [#5820](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5820) — Extended the production release workflow to build the EU Vercel target, annotate `console-logs-eu-prod`, and gate Slack notifications on the new job. Quarantined the flakiest Playwright suites while correcting the EU project ID, then updated the shared env schema so `production-eu` validates alongside the other release targets.
