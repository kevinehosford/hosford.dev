### Overview
Ship week for flows and table UX: I landed the new table primitives, wired flows onto them, and filled in the empty corners of the flows editor. Also closed several correctness gaps in tabular totals and trace linking.

### Highlights
- [#2872](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2872), [#2917](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2917), [#2924](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2924), [#2899](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2899), [#2893](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2893) — Introduced the reusable `Table` primitives (with cva-driven variants, selectable rows, and proper border handling) and moved the flows lists/destinations UI onto them. While there I tuned validation and routing so the editor stops spamming stream queries for non-canary orgs, added destination activity panels, and refined the forms so empty states and routes inputs mirror the rest of the design system.
- [#2946](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2946), [#2942](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2942), [#2895](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2895), [#2892](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2892) — Fixed a trio of tabular quirks: totals now pick the real `_totals` table (with a fallback when we only get aggregates), group keys use the actual field value instead of an empty string, boolean cardinality counts populate the query-builder, and highlighted series are read from `EventsTableStore` so selections sync across charts.
- [#2911](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2911), [#2908](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2908) — Cleaned up traces detail by stripping our `_`-prefixed internals from the sidebar while leaving `_time` intact, and fixed the span-link generator so Playwright can jump to the right trace node again.
