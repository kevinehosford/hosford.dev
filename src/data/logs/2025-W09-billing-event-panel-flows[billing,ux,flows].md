### Overview
Focused on closing the loop for billing compute credit purchases, polishing the event panel UX, and tightening the flows experience with better failure handling and tooling updates.

### Highlights
- [#3937](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3937), [#3955](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3955) — Added the compute credits drawer using the renamed `SettingsSlideout` + `SettingsSlideoutForm`, complete with helper copy and mutation wiring via `purchaseCreditsMutationOptions`. For now the credits card only renders under `isEnvLocal()` so the team can iterate without shipping the purchase flow prematurely. Lesson: building slideouts as composable forms lets us surface new purchase flows without reworking the settings shell.
- [#3928](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3928), [#3947](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3947) — Turned the event panel field list into a first-class multi-select with a sticky action popover, added “copy link to event”, and ensured `flattenObject` supplies the context payload instead of `extractEntryRowData`. Lesson: treating field selection as the source of truth fixes missing filters and finally gives support a sharable URL to specific events.
- [#3943](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3943), [#3957](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3957), [#3946](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3946) — Extended the flow destination form with a failure-handling select, sorted the kind lists for canary users, disabled save while mutations run, and added aggregate tooltips for the Sankey nodes/edges in Insights. Also flipped `isAxiomHybrid` to rely solely on `Org.isByos`, matching the backend flag. Lesson: keeping the flow UX responsive (and accurate) reduces the red bar churn we see when destinations misbehave.
- [#3929](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3929), [#3938](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3938) — Bumped the Monaco extension package and cleared a dependabot alert so the editor keeps pace with the latest language-service fixes.
