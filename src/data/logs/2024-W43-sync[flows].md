### Overview
Continued the flows migration to the new API, polished copy, and kept approvals/playwright healthy.

### Highlights
- [#3155](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3155), [#3192](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3192) — Swapped the flows components onto the upcoming API and tuned the language.
- [#3174](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3174), [#3156](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3156) — Ensured tabular values are flattened and cursor handling uses the response status instead of entry IDs.
