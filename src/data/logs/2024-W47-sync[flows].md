### Overview
Prepped tabular for rollout while tightening flows state handling and locking down Playwright in CI.

### Highlights
- [#3398](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3398), [#3383](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3383), [#3403](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3403) — Final tabular polish: smarter filters, better flattened keys, and rollout toggles.
- [#3392](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3392), [#3390](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3390), [#3388](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3388) — Moved flows onto the states endpoint, fixed stream stop behaviour, and ensured forms provide the correct APL.
- [#3397](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3397), [#3354](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3354) — Migrated query-library tests to Playwright/backstop and made Playwright a required CI gate.
