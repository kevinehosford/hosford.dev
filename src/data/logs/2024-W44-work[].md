### Overview
Swapped the streams UI over to the new API, enriched observability, and kept store/query state in sync.

### Highlights
- [#3236](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3236) — Moved the stream UI to the dedicated Streams API instead of `continuousMode`.
- [#3231](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3231) — Attached `trace-id` to Faro telemetry to tighten cross-tool debugging.
- [#3219](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3219), [#3110](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3110) — Ensured vfields only depend on older fields and added a helper to synchronise MobX stores with React Query.
