### Overview
Delivered enterprise-focused billing components, polished support/dashboards behaviour, and shipped quality-of-life updates for flows.

### Highlights
- [#4439](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4439), [#4433](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4433) — Added dedicated enterprise payment cards (with billing history and “manage invoice” actions) and made sure the payment-method section shows up for Stripe-billed orgs.
- [#4280](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4280) — Brought stop/resume controls plus better empty states to flow progress so long-running replays are easier to manage.
- [#4441](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4441) — Prevented dashboards from navigating away every time a chart renders, eliminating a painful focus regression.
- [#4451](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4451) — Pointed support’s internal notes at a plain thread so incident context stays in one place.
- [#4443](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/4443) — Swapped in swagger-generated API references to remove drift before the next SDK cut.
