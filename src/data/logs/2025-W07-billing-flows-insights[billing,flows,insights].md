### Overview
Rounded out the billing plan page with a license drawer and richer summary data, and kept iterating on the Flows Insights experiment by tightening the Sankey UX and hardening the history queries.

### Highlights
- [#3836](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3836), [#3811](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3811) — Added a license slide-out to `PlanPage` by teaching `SidebarPortal` to accept a trigger and wrapping it in a reusable `SettingsSlideOut`. The drawer hydrates with `getStatusUsageQuery`, `listIngressQuery`, and the active license so we can show the query window and ingress footprint. Also removed the dead remove-add-on modal wiring that the forthcoming swagger update would have broken. Lesson: slimming down the plan page hover logic made it easier to bolt on contextual data without duplicating modal code.
- [#3824](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3824) — Gave the Sankey chart a gradient-aware link renderer, exposed per-link tooltips with raw event counts, and added a “Top pairs” table powered by `filterLinks` plus new vitest coverage. Lesson: treating the Sankey as a navigable graph lets us highlight the slice of flow traffic the tooltip is focused on.
- [#3826](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3826) — Introduced `SAFE_FLOW_HISTORY`, a wrapper that uses `column_ifexists` to provide default values for every flow history column so Insights and the progress widget stop crashing when a dataset lacks schema. Lesson: normalising the history dataset in APL is safer than sprinkling `ensure_field` checks in every query.
- [#3865](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3865) — Bumped `@axiomhq/monaco-apl` to 0.0.15 (with language-service 0.2.17) to pick up the latest autocomplete and schema fixes for the editor. Lesson: repeatedly exercising the editor on the new Insights view keeps us honest about staying current with the APL tooling.
