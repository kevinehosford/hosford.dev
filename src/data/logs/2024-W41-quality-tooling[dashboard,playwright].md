### Overview
Invested the week in polishing dashboard interactions, tightening the Playwright workflow, and rebalancing our dependency hygiene after a bad bump. Also regenerated the swagger clients so the app can manage saved views from the new API surface.

### Highlights
- [#3066](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3066), [#3063](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3063) — Kept the chart header actions mounted during drag operations by teaching `ChartHeader`/`NoteChart` to toggle opacity instead of unmounting the menu, which prevents the grid from swallowing clicks (`draggingOrResizing` now flows through `BasicChartLayout`). While I was in there, I refreshed the Playwright tooling: the Docker commands now pass `PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING` through, we widened local timeouts, and added an example spec plus HAR fixtures so teammates can run the UI runner from the container with mocks and screenshot capture baked in.
- [#3047](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3047), [#3067](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3067) — Squashed a couple of UI regressions: the log stream view no longer shows the structured status bar and its field context menu only renders when a handler is wired, and `SidebarNavMenuItem` now forwards refs correctly to silence the React warning in production. I also bumped the log table’s Virtuoso overscan to smooth out scroll rendering.
- [#3065](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3065) — Regenerated the swagger bundles after pulling the latest backend spec, which adds the `/views` CRUD endpoints and corresponding `View` types to both the frontend and server codegen. The v2 clients were re-emitted alongside the new org metadata so the dashboards can start persisting saved views safely.
- [#3091](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3091), [#3092](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3092), [#3098](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3098), [#3099](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3099), [#3109](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3109) — Took a swing at rolling forward `next-auth`, `express`, and Vite to clear Dependabot alerts but quickly reverted the patch when it broke downstream builds, then reconfigured Dependabot to file security fixes only so we can stage manual test plans. While there, I bumped the frontend worker package to `0.12.0` to publish the latest language-service bits without dragging in the broken dependency set.
