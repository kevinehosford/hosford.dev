### Overview
Invested heavily in agent ergonomics this week: formalized the AGENT playbook, wired Cursor’s background agent to our scripts, and gave Bugbot clearer guardrails. Also tidied the query/dataset UI (CSV export, empty states, histogram tooltips) while keeping CI stable with runner and dependency refreshes.

### Highlights
- [#5121](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5121), [#5180](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5180), [#5192](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5192), [#5181](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5181) — Published a comprehensive `AGENT.md` plus style guide, then updated the install/clean scripts so every workspace (and Cursor’s background agent) picks up the rules with the right include headers. The extra context block now shows up in agents’ consoles, so they see the same constraints humans do.
- [#5175](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5175), [#5178](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5178), [#5179](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5179), [#5172](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5172) — Added a minimal `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`, told automated reviewers to ignore the `.cursor` directory, customised the background-agent Docker image, and dropped a PR template so external contributors follow the same checklist.
- [#5147](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5147), [#5153](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5153), [#5146](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5146) — Refactored `EventsTableStore` so CSV copy/download uses the projected column set (with thorough unit tests), surfaced ingest instructions whenever a dataset reports 0 bytes, and cleaned up the spectrograph tooltip copy to match design.
- [#5140](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5140) — Added `scripts/update-playwright-snapshots.mjs` so we can sync local screenshots from downloaded test artifacts in one command.
- [#5160](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5160), [#5130](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5130) — Moved every workflow to Depot’s 16 GB runners to stop OOMs and bumped Axios/Form-Data to clear Dependabot’s security advisory.
