### Overview
Dragged Nexus another step toward parity this week: merged the 08/21 `main` snapshot, fought a barrage of Playwright flakes, and kept the AI/dashboard surfaces healthy. Most of the time went into stabilising our seeded data loop and tightening CI so the migration proofs stay trustworthy.

### Highlights
- [#5345](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5345) — Pulled the late-August `main` branch into Nexus, reconciling the latest router, auth, and dashboard changes so the migration work continues on top of a fresh baseline.
- [#5272](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5272), [#5288](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5288) — Added the scheduled seeding/trim workflow that populates deterministic HTTP/K8s logs each night, bundled the helper scripts (`seed-fixtures`, `seed-trimming`, loader utilities), and then throttled the cron to run daily instead of every minute so CI isn’t constantly churning data.
- [#5339](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5339), [#5293](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5293), [#5415](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5415), [#5309](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5309), [#5311](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5311), [#5287](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5287), [#5290](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5290) — Reworked the Playwright scaffolding with page/component fixtures, new stream/query seeds, and CI wiring so lint/typecheck/coverage all run off the same `npm ci` install. Along the way we hardened auth cookie helpers, tweaked retries/workers, cleaned up spotlight/query race conditions, and fixed the traces sidebar overflow that was swallowing scrollbars.
- [#5320](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5320), [#5291](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5291) — Patched the generated-dashboard flow by skipping the “auto-save” path until the confirmation modal fires, and stopped the Percentiles chart from blowing out the axis when uPlot sees a `log(0)`.
