### Overview
Focused on smoothing the dashboard experience, tightening how we stream tables, and beefing up the telemetry that explains each deployment. Also paved the way for the APL-only query path while giving the flows UI some desperately needed empty states.

### Highlights
- [#3025](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3025), [#3029](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3029) — Introduced `QueryQueueStore` so dashboards drip-feed chart queries based on window size instead of blasting them all at once; each panel registers for a grant and we cap concurrent “usage” at four. `Chart.tsx` now keys its spinner off `getChartDataOps.loading`, so every widget shows a loading state while it waits its turn, which makes initial renders far more predictable.
- [#3019](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3019), [#2984](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2984), [#3017](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3017), [#3010](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3010) — Rebuilt the Logs stream table so headers stop jumping: column widths are now resizable, virtualization uses sticky context, and we persist the sizing state. At the same time we re-enabled `includeCursorField` behind the tabular flag, taught `ExtendedAplResult` to surface `_cursor`/`_rowID`, and hardened the value formatter pipeline (wrapping in `safeValueFormat` and keying off `unit`) so mixed-type columns still render correctly. Together that unlocks “view in context” without blowing up the UI.
- [#3000](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3000), [#3020](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3020), [#2994](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2994), [#2998](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2998), [#3009](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3009), [#3028](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3028) — Expanded observability: Faro now tags every session with active feature flags and captures console errors/warnings, and our CI/release workflows drop Axiom annotations (dev/staging/prod/EU) with the commit SHA plus a link back to GitHub. I also plumbed `AXIOM_URL` into the workflow envs and fixed the staging-release typo so the annotation action can post successfully.
- [#2999](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2999) — Added proper empty states across the flows workspace, including CTA links via the new `EmptyStateLink` helper and a friendlier destinations list. Along the way we tightened the button copy/styles so the experience matches the rest of the flows revamp.
- [#2934](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2934) — Smoothed the path to APL-only execution: a new `createQueryObjectRequestPayload` translates structured requests into APL, guarded by a feature flag so we can sandbox the switch. `DatasetStore`, `LogStreamStore`, and `QueryHistoryStore` now decide at runtime whether to hit the APL-only client, and we added zod validation plus tests to prove the payload matches the backend contract.
