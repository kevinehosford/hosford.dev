### Overview
Shipped the rowId-less event panel work, cleaned up the supporting tabular/joins code paths, and tidied a few flows edge cases before the holiday break.

### Highlights
- [#3610](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3610), [#3600](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3600), [#3589](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3589) — Reworked `LogStreamStore` and the query event stack so the event panel no longer relies on `_rowId`. We now fall back to the status cursors that come back with the result set, extend `ExtendedAplResult` to surface `_cursor_current`, and plumb the new context cursor through `EventsTableStore`. That lets rowId-less aggregations (especially tabular APL) render timelines, highlights, and context navigation without the panel crashing.
- [#3605](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3605), [#3604](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3604), [#3617](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3617), [#3602](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3602), [#3603](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3603), [#3552](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3552) — Tightened a pile of tabular edge cases: structured charts now read from `entry.data`, the stream path stops recomputing `dataKeys`, argmin/argmax respect aliases, `percentilesif` is treated like the other percentile aggs, and we flattened nested tabular payloads so joins/random totals don’t blow up. That also removed the regressions we introduced when we first tried to retrofit the event panel onto tabular output.
- [#3612](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3612) — Join queries were still fetching the timeline dataset and hammering the backend; the join path now skips that extra request which dropped load time by ~40 ms on my dev dataset.
- [#3580](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3580), [#3541](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3541) — Moved the flows preview label into the page header and made sure validation errors bubble back to the new modal flows use for destinations. That keeps the preview status visible while navigating and gives users the error details instead of swallowing them in the notifier.
- [#3591](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3591) — TrackJS was reporting a Faro session call-stack overflow, so we now register the session once during `init.ts` and share it through the Faro helper instead of repeatedly reinitializing inside Authed. The change also trims some of the feature-flag plumbing that used to shift Faro state on every render.
