### Overview
Flows kept evolving: I tightened the preview and replay experience, introduced a proper early-access funnel, and cleaned up the auth surface while continuing the percentile chart merge work.

### Highlights
- [#2539](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2539), [#2547](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2547), [#2552](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2552), [#2565](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2565) — Flow replays now surface API errors inline, the diff preview re-queries so both sides always render, and the prerelease page swaps in the branded art with the new Tally signup (hidden fields now ride along so we capture org context). Together those changes move early-access users from a static banner into a working beta loop.
- [#2548](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2548), [#2545](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2545), [#2555](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2555) — Finished the percentile chart merge: `ElementsDatasetStore` builds the combined series, `LineChart` handles shaded ranges and `displayNull` directly, and Histogram charts lean on the same props so merged cards keep their annotations without null rows creeping back in.
- [#2579](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2579), [#2559](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2559), [#2589](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2589) — Added the `axiom-idp` NextAuth provider (accepts callbacks without `state`) and removed the redundant state check for the legacy Axiom provider. Also hid the Flows entry from the Play layout so we don’t expose half-built surfaces outside the beta path.
- [#2569](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2569), [#2565](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/2565) — Updated the e2e fixtures to cover dataset selection calls and refreshed the prerelease artwork, keeping the Backstop snapshots and Playwright approvals green after the UI shuffle.
