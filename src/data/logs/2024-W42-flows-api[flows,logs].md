### Overview
Landed the flows API refresh and tightened how we present dataset fields after the backend renames. Also rewired the event viewers so nested JSON renders cleanly and traces no longer throw when spans omit numeric counters.

### Highlights
- [#3152](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3152) — Reorganized `frontend-swagger` into `/api/app` and `/api/v2` so the specs match the Rails repo, then regenerated both codegen bundles (`frontend/lib/dash/shared/dash/codegen/Dash.ts`, `frontend-server/src/lib/codegen/Dash.ts`) to bring in the new destination and flow types. Updated the flows UI (`RunsList.tsx`, `StopButton.tsx`) for the renamed `createdAt` field and the new `abortFlowReplay` mutation, and plugged the additional license metadata into `OrgStore` so the dashboard keeps loading.
- [#3030](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3030), [#3149](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3149) — Rebuilt the log event rendering pipeline with escape-aware dot-path parsing, `flattenObject` helpers, and new tests so the Event panel shows nested structures instead of piles of `unknown`. The traces sidebar now sanity-checks `dropped_events_count` and skips non-array spans, which stops the runtime errors we were seeing on malformed payloads.
- [#3148](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3148), [#3154](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3154) — Centralized field visibility in `DatasetStore` so builders and dataset overviews share an `activeDatasetVisibleFields` list, hiding anything the user has marked hidden. The query builder still exposes `_time` when you need to sort, but its pickers now filter out system columns for filters and aggregations, which keeps the UI aligned with what the API actually supports.
