### Overview
Launched the new logs field list and tightened the supporting query plumbing while wiring status messaging straight into the dashboard shell. Rounded things out with reliability fixes around datasets, histograms, and query parameter encoding.

### Highlights
- [#1191](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1191), [#1219](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1219) — Landed the explorer field list with virtualized selects, inline cardinality, and the `trimStringMiddle` helper so long field names stay readable. `ExtendedAplResult` exposes table metadata for `QueryFields`, and `LogsStream`/`Matches` now keep manual column picks in sync with the query meta. Using `extractDotValue` throughout fixes nested column rendering, so analysts can add or remove columns without breaking highlights.
- [#1222](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1222), [#1227](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1227) — Added a `StatusPageApi` client and `MaintenanceBanner` so authenticated users immediately see active maintenance pulled from Atlassian, with env wiring for `STATUS_PAGE_*` keys. The refreshed `EventBanner` promotes upcoming sessions with dismissals persisted in `safeLocalStorage`, keeping the dashboard’s top banner rotation purposeful instead of static marketing copy.
- [#1231](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1231), [#1230](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1230), [#1224](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1224) — Guarded the Play surface and dataset store against race conditions by honoring `getUserStatusOp.loading` and forcing `getActiveDataset()` when the stored ID drifts. Histogram queries now skip injecting `startTime`/`endTime` whenever the APL already scopes time, which avoids AXM-2087’s double-filter bug. Together those fixes stop flash-of-404 states and rebuild trends from using stale dataset metadata.
- [#1223](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/1223) — Standardized API calls to comma-separated query params by teaching the generated HTTP clients to use `query-string-for-all`. Pairing that with the new serializer ensures TanStack requests stop exploding array filters into `foo[]=a`, and it keeps both the server proxy and explorer tooling in lockstep when composing URLs.
