### Overview
Major push on editor and testing infrastructure: rebuilt the APL editor on top of our new monaco package, finished the Playwright migration by deleting the old harness, and delivered an add-ons management variant for the billing team while tidying shared UI surfaces.

### Highlights
- [#3670](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3670), [#3699](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3699) — Cut the cord on the legacy Backstop/e2e stack, removed the `E2E_TESTING` env toggles from stores like `LogStreamStore`, and rewired `npm run playwright` to build the app up front so UI mode shows progress. Re-recorded HAR fixtures, re-enabled the query metadata test, and refreshed the helper APIs so streaming stays live under Playwright. Lesson: with a single e2e harness we can simplify runtime flags and keep production codepaths under test.
- [#3660](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3660), [#3706](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3706) — Migrated the editor to `@axiomhq/monaco-apl`, swapping the webpack worker entry to the new `kusto.worker` and replacing all `window.monaco.languages.kusto` calls with `getKustoWorker()` helpers. Enabled token colorization once we bumped `monaco-editor(-core)` to 0.49 and verified autocomplete via a new Playwright spec that drives the intellisense dropdown. Lesson: capturing editor behavior in tests gives us room to take future Monaco upgrades without fear.
- [#3695](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3695), [#3692](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3692) — Prototyped the add-ons billing page with React Query hooks (`dashApi.getSubscriptionProducts`, `.updateSubscriptionProducts`) and a selection modal that matches the figjam mock. Introduced `ModalFooter`/`ModalOkButton` components and taught `ToggleButton` to expand so the layout holds steady. Feature is hidden behind the new `billing-add-ons` flag while we wire Stripe. Lesson: packaging reusable modal parts early keeps the billing surface consistent as we iterate.
- [#3684](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3684) — Wired the TanStack `MutationCache` through `handleNetworkError` so any mutation that sets `meta.toast` gets the same notification treatment as queries. Lesson: aligning query and mutation error handling keeps new flows from silently failing.
