### Overview
Spent the week hardening the Nexus staging stack: wired the dashboard over to typed TanStack links, unlocked the API proxy for preview environments, and brought BetterAuth one step closer to production readiness. We also trimmed our Vercel uploads and Playwright runtimes so the pipeline keeps up with the migration.

### Highlights
- [#5429](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5429) — Replaced the brittle MobX URL helpers with TanStack `linkOptions` and typed search params across dashboards, flows, monitors, and settings. The cleanup yanked thousands of lines of HAR fixtures, dropped the old `ChartSearch*` stores, and moved every navigation surface onto shared helpers (`Link`, `usePushOrGoBack`) so form editors and query tiles stay in sync.
- [#5480](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5480), [#5482](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5482), [#5431](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5431) — Enabled the Nexus API proxy for preview/dev by aligning our CORS headers with Atlas, then removed auth from the OPTIONS handlers so preflight requests reach the upstream service. While there, filled the missing PUT passthrough on `/api/internal` to unblock the internal metrics tools that were stuck on legacy.
- [#5495](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5495) — Added BetterAuth secondary storage backed by Redis, letting session lookups bypass Planetscale on repeat requests. The adapter is feature-flagged via env schema updates and came with small Playwright tweaks so traces still boot during the migration.
- [#5487](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5487), [#5486](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5486), [#5494](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5494), [#5496](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5496), [#5475](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5475) — Upgraded the Vercel deploy action to unlock `--archive=tgz`, switched our workflows to prebuilt archive uploads, and pushed the Playwright report through the same flag to dodge the rate limits. Capped retries, bumped worker counts, and rolled back the Sentry tunneling proxy so the pipeline speeds up without leaking PII.
