### Overview
Kept flows moving forward (new destinations and better config UX) while cleaning up tabular units and tightening dashboard fetches.

- [#3326](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3326), [#3309](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3309) — Ensured `_unit` metadata and optional fields behave for apl-only data.
- [#3299](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3299), [#3290](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3290) — Raised dashboard fetch limits and resolved circular dependencies uncovered during the rollout.
