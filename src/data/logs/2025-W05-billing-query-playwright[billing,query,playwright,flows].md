### Overview
Finished the new billing plan experience, tightened the query editor’s timing logic, and added more Playwright coverage so flows and flags behave predictably in test runs.

### Highlights
- [#3746](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3746), [#3765](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3765), [#3769](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3769), [#3757](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3757) — Rebuilt the plan management page: renamed it to `PlanPage`, swapped the card list for a real table with compact spacing, added the add-on sidebar redesign, and introduced the personal-plan upgrade comparison grid backed by helpers like `formatPlanCost`, `parsePrice`, and `PlanTileNext`. Also let `BasicForm` accept a `buttonsClassName` and cleaned up stray table cells so the layout snaps to the Figma spec. Lesson: centralising the plan UI lets billing, add-ons, and upgrade flows share the same primitives instead of duplicating markup.
- [#3771](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3771), [#3775](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3775), [#3761](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3761) — Fixed `getTableTimeRange` so it clamps to bucket boundaries, added Jest coverage for odd ball ranges, and filtered empty series when building chart data. While there, bumped `@axiomhq/monaco-apl` and `language-service-next`, stopped initialising the editor in read-only mode, and wrapped `setSchemaFromShowSchema` in a promise chain so a worker hiccup just logs an error instead of freezing the UI. Lesson: keeping the editor responsive during schema load exposes backend bugs without blocking analysts.
- [#3759](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3759), [#3762](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3762) — Updated `TiledLayout` to use CSS variables for fractional sizing and made flow detail tiles resizable so replay charts stop jumping. Captured that layout with a new Playwright screenshot test that waits for the chart render via `ChartHelper`. Lesson: pairing layout fixes with visual tests keeps regressions from sneaking back in.
- [#3756](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3756) — Forced Playwright to use the default/mock LaunchDarkly flag set by short-circuiting `useFlags()` when `IS_TESTING` is true, preventing real flag flips from breaking CI suites. Lesson: our e2e harness needs deterministic feature gates.
