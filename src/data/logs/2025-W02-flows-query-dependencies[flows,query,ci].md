### Overview
Focused on hardening the query experience while finishing the Flow work for Google Cloud Storage. Also had to back out a dependency upgrade after it broke preview authentication, which reinforced the need to guard risky platform changes.

### Highlights
- [#3667](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3667) — Added full GCS support to Flow destinations by extending `EditDestinationForm` with a new `gcs` branch in the zod schema, a Monaco-backed JSON editor for service account credentials, and updated Combobox options in `FlowsNavMenu`. Regenerated the Dash client to expose the subscription product endpoints and new repo types so the UI can persist the destination. Lesson: when we add destinations, keep the shared schema in sync so React Hook Form validation and the generated client stay aligned.
- [#3511](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3511) — Removed the long-lived `apl-only` feature flag and now always route Explorer queries through `createQueryObjectRequestPayload`, which keeps the APL payload consistent and lets us transform the result before returning. Commented out the last Backstop scenarios that relied on the legacy path. Lesson: retiring the dual-path query code shrinks the surface area for regressions and makes visual tests more predictable.
- [#3643](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3643) — Stopped the Query Library from crashing when a dataset was missing by treating `findIndex` returning `-1` as “not found” and wrapping the popover in `ErrorBoundary` so the rest of the editor keeps working. Lesson: we should keep error boundaries right next to dynamic widgets so a single failure does not take down the whole page.
- [#3644](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3644) — Reverted the automated Next.js 14 upgrade after it broke preview deploy login flows; rolling back the `package-lock` returned us to 13.5 and restored preview authentication. Lesson: always run through preview auth before landing framework upgrades.
