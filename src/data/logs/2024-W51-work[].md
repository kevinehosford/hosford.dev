### Overview
Closed out the year by tightening tabular range handling and making the ordered stringify helper resilient.

### Highlights
- [#3628](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3628) — Taught the ordered stringify helper to deal with plain primitives and booleans rather than throwing. That keeps the memoized diffing logic stable when we serialise dataset metadata for comparison.
- [#3616](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3616) — Added guards around invalid table ranges so queries that return empty buckets keep the existing view instead of crashing the inspector. Support reported the regression earlier in the week and the extra checks removed the TrackJS noise immediately.
