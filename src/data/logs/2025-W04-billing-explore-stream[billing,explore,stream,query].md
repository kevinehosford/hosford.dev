### Overview
Split the week between reshaping the billing workflow and tightening the log/query tables. Built new explore and add-on experiences while pulling store side-effects into React Query, and made the time column behave predictably across query results and live stream.

### Highlights
- [#3720](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3720), [#3731](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3731), [#3735](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3735) — Introduced the explore plans page and add-on sidebar, leaning on `useBillingDetails`, `useStripePortal`, and fresh `AddOnSidebar`/`BillingProductsPage` components to manage subscription products. Refactored `BillingStore` so upgrade/downgrade operations return promises, update the React Query cache via `queryClient.setQueryData`, and rely on the caller for toast or navigation. Added preview endpoints and helpers like `getPreviewSubscriptionProductsQuery`. Lesson: moving the side-effects into the consumer makes the store simpler and keeps UI state in sync with the query cache.
- [#3728](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3728), [#3741](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3741) — Calculated `_time` column widths from the actual formatted string in `EventsTable`, adding `formatTimeCell` to share the logic, and forced the log stream path to suppress the year with the new `withoutYear` flag on `formattedDateShort`. Lesson: virtualization behaves when the column width is stable, so time formatting needs to be deterministic across months and year boundaries.
- [#3740](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/3740) — Trimmed the dangling `playwright:show-report` invocation from the approval script after switching to the new Playwright workflow. Lesson: small CI fixes prevent false negatives during screenshot approvals.
