### Overview
Massive shell refactor this week: Nexus now ships a pre-rendered SPA shell, caches its assets aggressively, and boots faster on every visit. Rounded out the work by fixing auth flows that regressed during the migration and restoring our tracing story.

### Highlights
- [#5519](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5519), [#5511](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5511), [#5516](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5516) — Enabled TanStack SPA mode so Vercel serves `_shell.html` for every non-API request, turned off SSR, and slimmed the root layout to a loading frame with a spinner. `nitro.config.ts` now stamps immutable cache headers onto hashed assets, `Link.tsx` gained SPA-friendly navigation, and the pending shell component keeps the UI from flashing during client boot.
- [#5531](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5531), [#5522](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5522) — Replaced the last next-auth logout hook with a BetterAuth-backed `/frapi/auth/sign-out` route so we actually delete sessions alongside Atlas tokens. Fresh orgs now redirect into the onboarding flow until the `gettingStarted` data syncs, which keeps the dashboard from dropping 403s after you create the company record.
- [#5497](https://github.com/axiomhq/app/pull/5497) — Restored end-to-end tracing by pushing the auth session and access tokens into the request context and reworking our `startActiveSpan` helpers to lazily grab tracers. The change cuts redundant Planetscale reads, fixes the initialization race where Otel dependencies were still loading, and re-enables span emission across `/frapi` and the server functions.
